API-driven reimagining of the SDLC (Solution Delivery Lifecycle) process

A little domain-driven design (**DDD**)...
Let's consider the domains in play in the SDLC.
1) Users - the people who will be participating in the process
2) Roles - the various roles the *Users* will assume throughout the process
3) Artifacts - the various work products that are produced throughout the process
4) Releases (aka, Solution Releases) - a defined collection of Artifacts which ultimately results in a Solution getting deployed into production
